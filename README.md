Run the project, cd to it, and download dependencies by running autogen.sh (./autogen.sh). Make sure that you're in the correct repository. You can log in with username a@a and password hi, or you can create a new account.

Please make sure that you do not have any important processes running on ports 8000 or 5173. autogen.sh kills processes on those two ports to make room for the server and client, respectively.
