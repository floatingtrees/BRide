Run the project, cd to it, and download dependencies by running autogen.sh (./autogen.sh). Make sure that you're in the correct repository, because there is a rm -rf command in the shell script and it uses relative pathing, so you might accidentally remove something important if you're in the wrong directory. You can log in with username a@a and password hi, or username b@b and password hi2.
